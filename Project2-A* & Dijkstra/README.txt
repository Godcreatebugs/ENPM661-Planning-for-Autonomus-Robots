HOW TO RUN ---->>
1. Open Astar.py and run it(For a* algorithm)
2. Open Dijstra.py and run it.(For Dijstra algorithm)
(Keep other files in the same folder)

OTHER INSTRUCTION  TO RUN:
1.Enter the radius, resoltion,start and end node

2.For Astar algorithm you will get the nodes explored.

3. To make astar for point robot kindly put zero in radius.

4. To make dijstra for point robot put 0 as radius

5.I have also used a command that will automatically make a node exploration path used cost involved in it.

6..It is seen that considering diagonal path has reduced the cost in simple case like (1,1) to (50,50)

RUN TIME---->>>
Run time for simple cases for astar was 40 sec and 50 sec for dijstra
Run time for long path with resoltion 1 for astar was around 2-3 minutes.
Run time for dijstra is 7 minutes and you will be given an node and path files.

AFTER RUN------->>>>
After running A* algorithm node and path file will be generated
After Runiing Dijstra algorithm node path and graph will be generated.
